## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 6, part 2
This lab was one of my favorites because I have played Blackjack before, so it was fun to actually program the scoring rules myself. I enjoyed breaking the game into functions that handled things like aces, face cards, and busting. This lab helped me understand how logic, conditionals, and small functions work together to create a real system.

Lab 7
Lab 7 was one of my favorites because it felt like working on a real app that could help people understand the parking rules in a city. I enjoyed figuring out the different restrictions for each street and turning the signs into clear, logical functions for people to understand. It was fun translating real world rules into code, and the lab helped me get better at writing conditionals and handling multiple cases cleanly.

lab 8, part 1
This part of the lab was my favorite because not only was it fun using the olympics as a fun coding experience but it also challenged me to write an algorithm that removes bias from a set of scores. I enjoyed using loops to find the minimum and maximum scores and then calculating the adjusted average, which helped me understand how to manipulate data stored in vectors. Implementing this function taught me about careful arithmetic with floating-point numbers, proper use of loops, and step-by-step problem-solving to achieve an accurate and fair result.
